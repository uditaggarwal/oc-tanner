In other websites, customers does not know that where the product comes. Here all customers are able to know the details of retailer like location, shop name etc. 
This is e-commerce plate for buying and selling the product at own their cost and also customer may give the reviews to the products so, that shop owner make thing good as possible. Everyone wants the business online even small shop. Shop owner register here with their credentials and make account for shop. He uploads the product and share the shop name and location also. Now, when customers comes to online store and see different products as per requirement, he made purchased from particular shop.

## Problem Statement
The online store web application sets up a dashboard for shop owner so that he makes their shop like offline method Also, customers can easily track their location. This system also provides a review system in which user can rate the purchased items.                                                                   ii

## Methodology:
It outlines how data will be collected and tools for collecting data. Model view controller (MVC) is software design for developing web applications. It consists three parts like

1. Model -The lowest level of the pattern which is responsible for maintaining data.
2. View-It is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.
3. Controller-Software code that controls the interaction between model and view.

## Working: 
MVC isolates the application logic from the user interface layer and supports separation of concern. Here controller receives all requests for the application and then work with model to prepare any data needed by the view. The view then uses the data prepared by the controller to generate a final presentable response. It can be understood with the following diagram.
